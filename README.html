<h1>Firebug logging bundle for [textmate](http://macromates.org) editor</h1>

Usefull for the JavaScript developers who tired by infinite console.logâ€¦ typing
This bundle introduce following snippets:

<h2>Primitive logging:</h2>

type <code>log[tab]</code>
and you should receive <code>console.log('%CURSOR_POSITION%');</code>

## Parametric logging:

type <code logp</code>
and you should receive same snippet as above with ability to define which variable to dump into log:
<code>console.log('Object: %o', Object)</code>, where you can replace Object for whatever you want

## Info-level logging

Same as primitive logging, but instead 'log' command it shell produce <code>console.info('%CURSOR_POSITION%');</code> so that firebug should add nifty icon for that log message (may be usefull with firebug output filters)

## Warn-level logging

Same as above, but you should receive no 'info' command but 'warn'.
